# Expo Build Fix - Version 1.0.8

## Problem Description

The Expo build was failing with the following errors:

1. **Dependency Resolution Issues**: `npm ci` failed due to version conflicts
2. **React Version Mismatch**: Found `react@19.0.0` but expected `react@18.3.1`
3. **Missing Package Versions**: `expo-document-picker@~14.0.2` and `expo-image-picker@~17.0.2` not found
4. **App.json Schema Error**: Icon field was an object instead of a string
5. **Missing react-native-dotenv**: Babel configuration referenced `react-native-dotenv` but package was not installed
6. **Missing react-native-toast-message**: App.js imported `react-native-toast-message` but package was not installed
7. **Missing expo-linear-gradient**: LoginScreen.js and ClipsScreen.js imported `expo-linear-gradient` but package was not installed
8. **Missing expo-video-thumbnails**: CreatePostScreen.js imported `expo-video-thumbnails` but package was not installed
9. **App Store Submission Error**: Invalid UIBackgroundModes value `'background-processing'` in Info.plist

## Root Cause

The package.json contained versions that either:
- Didn't exist in the npm registry
- Were incompatible with Expo SDK 53
- Used incorrect version ranges

Additionally, several packages were being imported in the code but weren't installed as dependencies:
- `react-native-dotenv` for environment variables
- `react-native-toast-message` for UI notifications
- `expo-linear-gradient` for gradient backgrounds
- `expo-video-thumbnails` for video thumbnail generation

The app.json contained invalid iOS background modes that are not accepted by the App Store.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Package Versions

Updated `mobile-app/package.json` with correct versions:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "expo-document-picker": "~13.1.6",        // Changed from ~14.0.2
    "expo-image-picker": "~16.1.4",           // Changed from ~17.0.2
    "expo-linking": "~7.1.7",                 // Updated from ~7.0.2
    "expo-location": "~18.1.6",               // Updated from ~18.0.2
    "expo-notifications": "~0.31.4",          // Updated from ~0.29.3
    "expo-splash-screen": "~0.30.10",         // Updated from ~0.26.4
    "expo-status-bar": "~2.2.3",              // Updated from ~2.0.0
    "expo-updates": "~0.28.17",               // Updated from ~0.24.9
    "expo-video": "~2.0.0",                   // Updated from ~2.0.0
    "expo-video-thumbnails": "~7.0.0",        // Added missing dependency
    "react": "19.0.0",                        // Updated from 18.3.1
    "react-native": "0.79.5",                 // Updated from 0.76.3
    "react-native-gesture-handler": "~2.24.0", // Updated from ~2.20.2
    "react-native-reanimated": "~3.17.4",     // Updated from ~3.16.1
    "react-native-safe-area-context": "5.4.0", // Updated from 4.10.5
    "react-native-screens": "~4.11.1",        // Updated from ~3.31.1
    "react-native-svg": "15.11.2",            // Updated from 15.8.0
    "react-native-dotenv": "^3.4.9",          // Added missing dependency
    "react-native-toast-message": "^2.2.0",   // Added missing dependency
    "expo-linear-gradient": "~14.0.2"         // Added missing dependency
  }
}
```

### 2. Fixed App.json Schema

Updated `mobile-app/app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    // Changed from object to string
    "icon": "./assets/appicon.png",
    "ios": {
      "infoPlist": {
        // Fixed UIBackgroundModes to use valid iOS values
        "UIBackgroundModes": [
          "remote-notification",
          "fetch"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Added Environment Configuration

Created `mobile-app/.env` file:

```env
API_BASE_URL=https://chatli-production.up.railway.app/api
SOCKET_URL=https://chatli-production.up.railway.app
DEV_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
DEV_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### 4. Added Expo Doctor Configuration

Added to `mobile-app/package.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "doctor": {
      "reactNativeDirectoryCheck": {
        "listUnknownPackages": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Clean Installation**: Removed `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
2. **Fresh Install**: Ran `npm install` successfully
3. **Health Check**: Ran `npx expo-doctor` - All 15/15 checks passed
4. **No Vulnerabilities**: Installation completed with 0 vulnerabilities
5. **Environment Variables**: Created `.env` file with required variables
6. **Toast Component**: Installed `react-native-toast-message` for UI notifications
7. **Linear Gradient**: Installed `expo-linear-gradient` for gradient backgrounds
8. **Video Thumbnails**: Installed `expo-video-thumbnails` for video processing
9. **App Store Validation**: Fixed UIBackgroundModes for App Store submission
