# 🔍 User Profile Debug Guide

## 🎯 Issue Description
User profile shows all posts from feed instead of only posts by that specific user.

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **API Endpoint Correction**
- **Before**: `/posts?author=${userId}` (incorrect)
- **After**: `/posts/user/${userId}` (correct)

### 2. **Enhanced Post Filtering**
- Added detailed console logging to track post filtering
- Improved error handling and fallback logic
- Better debugging information

### 3. **Cover Image Support**
- Added cover image display in UserProfileScreen
- Proper styling with avatar overlay
- Border styling for better visual appeal

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### **Step 1: Verify API Endpoint**
```javascript
// Check if the endpoint returns correct data
const response = await api.getUserPosts(userId);
console.log('User posts response:', response);
```

### **Step 2: Check Console Logs**
Look for these debug messages:
- `Found X posts for user userId`
- `Total posts in feed: X`
- `Looking for posts by user: userId`
- `Found post by user: postId - content...`
- `Filtered posts for user userId: X`

### **Step 3: Verify User Data**
```javascript
// Check if user profile includes coverImage
const userProfile = await api.getUserProfile(userId);
console.log('User profile:', userProfile.data.user);
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: Still showing all posts**
**Cause**: Backend endpoint might not exist or return wrong data
**Solution**: Check server logs for `/posts/user/:userId` endpoint

### **Issue 2: No posts showing**
**Cause**: User has no posts or filtering too strict
**Solution**: Check if `post.author._id === userId` comparison works

### **Issue 3: Cover image not showing**
**Cause**: User doesn't have coverImage field
**Solution**: Check if user profile includes coverImage in response

## 📱 Manual Testing

1. **Create test posts** with different users
2. **Navigate to user profile** by tapping user name in posts
3. **Verify only that user's posts** are shown
4. **Check cover image** displays correctly
5. **Test follow/unfollow** functionality

## 🔧 Backend Verification

### **Check Posts Route**
```bash
# Should return only posts by specific user
GET /api/posts/user/:userId
```

### **Check User Route**
```bash
# Should return user with coverImage field
GET /api/auth/users/:id
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior

- **User Profile**: Shows only posts by that user
- **Cover Image**: Displays if user has coverImage set
- **Avatar**: Overlays on cover image with white border
- **Follow Button**: Shows correct follow/unfollow state
- **Post Count**: Matches actual number of user's posts

## 🎉 Success Criteria

✅ User profile shows only user's own posts  
✅ Cover image displays correctly  
✅ Avatar positioned properly over cover  
✅ Follow/unfollow works correctly  
✅ Post count matches actual posts  
✅ Navigation works from all entry points
