# Network Connectivity Fix

## Issue Fixed
The mobile app was getting "Network request timed out" errors when trying to login because it was configured to use localhost URLs that don't work on real devices.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Service Update (`src/services/api.js`)
- **Before**: Used `http://10.0.2.2:5000/api` for development (Android emulator only)
- **After**: Always uses `https://chatli-production.up.railway.app/api` (your production Railway server)

### 2. Socket Service Update (`src/services/socket.js`)
- **Before**: Used localhost URLs for development
- **After**: Always uses `https://chatli-production.up.railway.app` for WebSocket connections

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added 30-second timeout for API requests
- Better error messages in Mongolian
- Automatic retry logic for failed connections
- User-friendly network error messages

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Clear Expo Cache
```bash
cd mobile-app
npx expo start --clear
```

### 2. Test Login
- Try logging in with your existing CHATLI credentials
- The app should now connect to your Railway backend
- Login errors should show proper Mongolian error messages

### 3. What to Expect
✅ **Success**: App connects to Railway backend  
✅ **Login**: Works with existing CHATLI credentials  
✅ **Real-time**: Chat and posts sync with web version  
✅ **Error Messages**: Clear, user-friendly messages in Mongolian  

### 4. Test Account
You can create a test account or use existing credentials from your web version.

## Backend Status
- ✅ **Railway Backend**: Running at `https://chatli-production.up.railway.app`
- ✅ **Database**: MongoDB Atlas connected
- ✅ **Socket.IO**: WebSocket connections enabled
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: All routes working

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting Timeout Errors:
1. **Check Railway Status**: Make sure your Railway deployment is running
2. **Test Web Version**: Verify `https://chatli-production.up.railway.app` works in browser
3. **WiFi Connection**: Make sure your phone has stable internet
4. **Firewall**: Some networks block WebSocket connections

### Railway Deployment Check:
```bash
# In your main project directory
railway status
railway logs
```

## Expected Result
After these fixes, your mobile app should successfully connect to the Railway backend and allow you to:
- Login with existing accounts
- Send/receive real-time messages
- View posts from the web version
- Create new posts and chats
- Receive notifications

The mobile and web versions now share the same backend completely!
