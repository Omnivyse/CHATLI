# 🚀 QUICK FIX - Expo Installation Issue

## ❌ The Problem
You're getting "Unable to find expo in this project" because:
1. The Expo package isn't properly installed
2. You might have an old global Expo CLI conflicting

## ✅ QUICK SOLUTION

### Step 1: Clean Everything
```bash
cd mobile-app

# Delete everything and start fresh
rmdir /s node_modules
del package-lock.json
del yarn.lock
```

### Step 2: Install Expo CLI Globally (Latest Version)
```bash
# Uninstall old version
npm uninstall -g expo-cli

# Install new Expo CLI
npm install -g @expo/cli
```

### Step 3: Create New Expo Project
Instead of manual setup, let's use Expo's built-in template:

```bash
# Go back to parent directory
cd ..

# Create a new Expo project
npx create-expo-app chatli-mobile --template blank

# Navigate to new project
cd chatli-mobile
```

### Step 4: Copy Our Custom Code
Now copy these files from the old `mobile-app` folder to the new `chatli-mobile` folder:
- `src/` folder (entire directory)
- Replace `App.js` with our custom version

### Step 5: Install Additional Dependencies
```bash
# Install navigation
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack @react-navigation/bottom-tabs

# Install required dependencies
npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated

# Install other packages
npm install socket.io-client react-native-modal react-native-toast-message react-native-image-viewing @react-native-async-storage/async-storage date-fns
```

### Step 6: Run the App
```bash
npx expo start
```

## 🎯 EVEN FASTER OPTION

If you want the absolute quickest solution:

```bash
# Just install Expo CLI and try again
npm install -g @expo/cli

cd mobile-app
npm install
expo start
```

## 🔄 Alternative: Use Expo Go App

1. **Download "Expo Go"** app on your phone
2. **Run:** `expo start` (or `npx expo start`)
3. **Scan QR code** with your phone camera or Expo Go app
4. **Test immediately** without any simulators!

## ✅ Success Signs

You should see:
```
› Metro waiting on exp://192.168.x.x:19000
› QR code appears
› Options: Press a │ open Android, i │ open iOS, w │ open web
```

## 🆘 If Still Not Working

Try this nuclear option:
```bash
# Use Yarn instead of NPM
npm install -g yarn
cd mobile-app
yarn install
yarn start
```
