# Sender Notification Fix - Version 1.0.8

## Problem Description

Users were receiving push notifications for their own messages, which is incorrect behavior:

**Scenario 1**: ‚úÖ User 1 (mobile) receives a notification when User 2 (web) sends a message ‚Äî This works correctly.

**Scenario 2**: ‚ùå User 1 (mobile) sends a message to User 2 (web), but User 1 also receives a notification ‚Äî This was incorrect.

## Root Cause

The issue was that the mobile app was receiving push notifications for all messages in a chat, including messages sent by the user themselves. While the server-side code was correctly filtering out the sender from the push notification recipients, there might have been edge cases or the mobile app wasn't properly filtering notifications on the client side.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Server-Side Enhancement

**Updated `server/services/pushNotificationService.js`**:
- Modified `sendMessageNotification` method to include `senderId` parameter
- Added sender ID to notification data payload

```javascript
// Before
async sendMessageNotification(pushToken, senderName, messageContent, chatId)

// After  
async sendMessageNotification(pushToken, senderName, messageContent, chatId, senderId)
```

**Updated `server/routes/chats.js`**:
- Modified push notification call to pass the sender ID
- Ensures sender ID is included in notification data

```javascript
await pushNotificationService.sendMessageNotification(
  participant.pushToken,
  req.user.name,
  messageText,
  chat._id.toString(),
  req.user._id.toString()  // Added sender ID
);
```

### 2. Client-Side Filtering

**Updated `mobile-app/src/services/pushNotificationService.js`**:
- Added `getCurrentUserId()` method to retrieve current user ID from AsyncStorage
- Enhanced `handleNotificationReceived()` to filter out notifications from the sender
- Added sender ID comparison logic

```javascript
// Filter out notifications from the sender
if (data && data.type === 'message' && data.senderId) {
  const currentUserId = await this.getCurrentUserId();
  if (currentUserId && data.senderId === currentUserId) {
    console.log('üîî Notification suppressed - sender is current user');
    return;
  }
}
```

### 3. Notification Data Structure

The push notification data now includes:
```javascript
{
  type: 'message',
  chatId: chatId,
  senderName: senderName,
  messageContent: messageContent,
  senderId: senderId  // New field for filtering
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Server-Side Changes

1. **Push Notification Service** (`server/services/pushNotificationService.js`):
   - Added `senderId` parameter to `sendMessageNotification` method
   - Included `senderId` in notification data payload
   - Enhanced logging to include sender ID

2. **Chat Routes** (`server/routes/chats.js`):
   - Updated push notification call to pass sender ID
   - Maintains existing server-side filtering for other participants

### Client-Side Changes

1. **Push Notification Service** (`mobile-app/src/services/pushNotificationService.js`):
   - Added `getCurrentUserId()` method for retrieving user ID from AsyncStorage
   - Enhanced `handleNotificationReceived()` with sender filtering logic
   - Made notification handler async to support AsyncStorage operations
   - Added proper error handling for async operations

2. **Notification Filtering Logic**:
   - Checks if notification is a message type
   - Compares sender ID with current user ID
   - Suppresses notification if sender is current user
   - Logs suppression for debugging purposes

## Testing Scenarios

### ‚úÖ Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **User 1 sends message to User 2**:
   - User 1: ‚ùå No notification (correct)
   - User 2: ‚úÖ Receives notification (correct)

2. **User 2 sends message to User 1**:
   - User 1: ‚úÖ Receives notification (correct)
   - User 2: ‚ùå No notification (correct)

3. **Group chat scenarios**:
   - Sender: ‚ùå No notification (correct)
   - Other participants: ‚úÖ Receive notifications (correct)

## Verification Steps

1. **Server-side verification**:
   - Check that `sendMessageNotification` includes sender ID
   - Verify chat routes pass sender ID correctly
   - Confirm server-side filtering still works

2. **Client-side verification**:
   - Test notification filtering in mobile app
   - Verify `getCurrentUserId()` retrieves correct user ID
   - Check notification suppression logs

3. **End-to-end testing**:
   - Test message sending between users
   - Verify sender doesn't receive own notifications
   - Confirm other users still receive notifications

## Files Modified

1. `server/services/pushNotificationService.js` - Added sender ID to notification data
2. `server/routes/chats.js` - Updated push notification call to include sender ID
3. `mobile-app/src/services/pushNotificationService.js` - Added client-side filtering
4. `mobile-app/SENDER_NOTIFICATION_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Correct Behavior**: Senders no longer receive notifications for their own messages
- ‚úÖ **Better UX**: Eliminates confusing self-notifications
- ‚úÖ **Reduced Noise**: Fewer unnecessary notifications for users
- ‚úÖ **Maintains Functionality**: Other users still receive notifications correctly
- ‚úÖ **Robust Filtering**: Both server-side and client-side filtering for reliability
