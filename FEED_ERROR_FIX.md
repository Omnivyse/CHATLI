# 🔧 Feed Error Fix Guide

## Problem
After deleting a user from the admin panel, the feed section shows "Алдаа гарлаа" (Error occurred) and console shows 500 server errors. This happens because:

1. **Orphaned posts** - Posts from deleted users still exist in database
2. **Broken references** - Posts trying to populate author field for non-existent users
3. **Missing cleanup** - Admin user deletion wasn't cleaning up related data

## ✅ Solution

### Step 1: Clean Up Orphaned Data
Run this script to clean up any existing orphaned posts:

```bash
cd server
node scripts/cleanup-orphaned-posts.js
```

This will:
- ✅ Delete posts from deleted users
- ✅ Clean up comments from deleted users
- ✅ Remove broken references

### Step 2: Verify Admin User Deletion Works
The admin user deletion has been improved to properly clean up all related data:
- ✅ Deletes all user posts
- ✅ Deletes all user messages
- ✅ Removes user from chats
- ✅ Deletes notifications
- ✅ Cleans up analytics data
- ✅ Removes from followers/following lists

### Step 3: Test the Fix
1. **Clear browser cache** and refresh
2. **Try accessing the feed** - should work now
3. **If still having issues**, run the cleanup script again

## 🚨 If Still Having Issues

### Check Server Logs
Look for these messages:
- ✅ "Found post with deleted author, skipping: [post_id]"
- ✅ "User [user_id] and all related data deleted successfully"

### Manual Database Check
If you have MongoDB access:
```javascript
// Check for orphaned posts
db.posts.find({author: {$exists: false}})

// Check for posts with non-existent authors
db.posts.find({author: {$exists: true}}).forEach(function(post) {
  var user = db.users.findOne({_id: post.author});
  if (!user) {
    print("Orphaned post: " + post._id);
  }
})
```

### Force Refresh
```javascript
// Run in browser console
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

## 📞 Support
If issues persist:
1. Check server logs for specific errors
2. Run the cleanup script again
3. Verify MongoDB connection
4. Check if any posts still have broken references

## 🔒 Prevention
Future user deletions will automatically clean up all related data, preventing this issue from happening again.
