# 🔒 CHATLI Platform Security Upgrade

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security improvements implemented in the CHATLI platform to protect against various cyber threats and vulnerabilities.

## 🚨 Critical Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. **Input Sanitization & Validation**
- **Before**: No input sanitization, vulnerable to XSS and injection attacks
- **After**: Comprehensive input sanitization using DOMPurify and custom validation
- **Protection**: XSS, SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection, Path Traversal

### 2. **JWT Token Security**
- **Before**: Weak JWT tokens with 7-day expiry, no device tracking
- **After**: Secure JWT with 2-hour expiry, refresh tokens, device fingerprinting
- **Protection**: Token theft, replay attacks, unauthorized access

### 3. **Rate Limiting**
- **Before**: Basic rate limiting only
- **After**: Granular rate limiting for different operations (auth, file upload, API calls)
- **Protection**: Brute force attacks, DDoS, API abuse

### 4. **File Upload Security**
- **Before**: Basic file type checking
- **After**: Magic number validation, extension verification, size limits, content analysis
- **Protection**: Malicious file uploads, executable files, oversized files

### 5. **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Before**: Simple user lookup
- **After**: Enhanced validation, account status checking, device verification
- **Protection**: Account takeover, unauthorized access, session hijacking
