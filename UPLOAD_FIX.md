# ðŸš¨ Upload Fix Guide - 500 Error

## Issue: File upload failing with 500 Internal Server Error

### Most Likely Cause: Missing Cloudinary Environment Variables in Railway

## âœ… Quick Fix Steps:

### 1. Check Railway Environment Variables
Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard) â†’ Your CHATLI Project â†’ **Variables** tab

**Verify these variables are set:**
```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dtwemkff6
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=453282523491793
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=wAS4HfMyQtI3vrPC3cTPTWQpYys
```

### 2. If Variables Are Missing:
Click **"New Variable"** and add each one:

```
Name: CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
Value: dtwemkff6

Name: CLOUDINARY_API_KEY  
Value: 453282523491793

Name: CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
Value: wAS4HfMyQtI3vrPC3cTPTWQpYys
```

### 3. Redeploy Railway
After adding variables:
- Railway will auto-redeploy (1-2 minutes)
- Or manually click "Deploy" â†’ "Redeploy"

### 4. Test Upload
Try uploading an image after redeploy completes.

## ðŸ”§ What I Fixed in Code:
- âœ… Auto-create upload directory if missing
- âœ… Better error handling for multer
- âœ… Improved file cleanup
- âœ… More detailed error logging
- âœ… Graceful error recovery

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result:
After setting Cloudinary variables:
- âœ… Image uploads work
- âœ… Video uploads work  
- âœ… Files upload to Cloudinary cloud
- âœ… No more 500 errors

## ðŸ“ž If Still Not Working:
1. Check Railway logs for Cloudinary errors
2. Verify Cloudinary account is active
3. Make sure API keys are correct
